Subject: Zero drift in discrete systems (impossible for 60 years) - Patent pending

We've built a physics-grade engine that achieves machine-precision conservation (ΔH≈1e-16) with live topology morphing and bit-exact replay. Baseline RNN drift is ~97.6%. Ours is 0.0%.

Artifacts (public):
• Paper (PDF): https://invariant.pro/papers/Zero_Drift_Neural_Computation.pdf
• Proof JSON: https://invariant.pro/proof/canonical_run_proof.json
• Figures: https://invariant.pro/validation/

We are gating the full ProofKit and procedures under NDA for validation partners.
